;; Quesstion
;;
;; You can represent a table in lisp by making each row a list and collecting all the rows in a list. E.g. a table like,
;;
;; 9 4 8
;; 2 5 6
;; 7 3 1
;;
;; gets represented as:
;;
;; ((9 4 8) (2 5 6) (7 3 1))
;;

;; Define a procedure FOO that takes a table and a procedure, and returns a two
;; element list. The first element of the returned list will be the number of
;; the column which yields the highest value when the argument procedure is
;; applied, the second element of the returned list will be the result obtained
;; for this column. For instance, when the procedure is called with the above
;; table and a procedure that gives the average of a list of numbers, the
;; output should be (1 6), where 1 is the number of the column with the highest
;; average and 6 is the average of that column. Note that column counting
;; starts with 1.

;; first we need a procedure that collects the columns of a table into a list

(defun get-columns (table)

    (dotimes (i (length (car table)) (reverse columns))

                  (nth i row)
                  acc )))
            columns))))

;; then a procedure that computes the values obtained by applying an argument procedure to lists

(defun bar (proc lst)
  (mapcar
    #'(lambda (x) (apply proc x))
    lst))

;; then a procedure that indexes a list starting from 1

(defun index (lst &optional (index 1))
  (if lst
      (cons (list index (car lst))
            (index (cdr lst) (+ index 1)))))

(defun indexed-max (indexed-lst)
  (reduce
    #'(lambda (x y) (if (> (cadr x) (cadr y)) x y))
